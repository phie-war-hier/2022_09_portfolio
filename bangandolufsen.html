						<p>bang & olufsen offers exclusive sailing trips under the name B&O Turns - develop a communication strategy, its design idea and visual elaboration according to a briefing. the work was created in the context of a semester project in the subject communication strategy and is not an official order of the brand bang & olufsen.</p>
						<p>bang & olufsen is a luxury audio brand that not only sells speakers, headphones and co. at a high price, but also represents a certain lifestyle. this stands for simplicity, elegance and for the extraordinary. music, which comes to the listener through bang & olufsen products, plays a major role in the overall brand communication. sentences of an interview like "music is like flying, music is motivation." are especially underlined. the interaction of everyday life with music and a "smart" home also takes center stage. the claim "music gets you there", which is also used by bang & olufsen itself, sums up this promise very well in my opinion; in place of "music", one could also insert "bang & olufsen gets you there" instead.</p>
						<p>the target group can be reached especially through exclusive media, which can be for example a magazine (analog or digital) or blogs. this can also be payTV or alternative movie and music streaming services. the brand can also reach its target group in cooperation with other brand products. an example of this would also be the current cooperation with the italian shoe and leather manufacturer beluti. in all media, the emotionality and passion should always be conveyed, whether through motivating interviews and stories or through inspiring images and films.</p>

						<p>"passion gets you there". the claim "music gets you there" was modified by me and "music" was replaced by passion. the picture is the ra II, a replica of an antique reed boat built by thor heyerdahl in 1970, with which he and his crew, consisting of seven intercultural members, sailed from safi (morocco) to barbados (an island off south america).</p>

						<p>"we left nothing to chance." the claim and the image are mainly to point out the quality and safety of bang & olufsen turns. with bang & olufsen, everyone reliably reaches their destination, nothing is left to chance, even with a wind-dependent means of travel.</p>

						<p>"time flies, distance flies. burst all limits." as picture i chose the berlin wall at the opening. the image represents very emotionally the departure, courage and dissolution of borders. the claim and the image convey such a powerful and emotional message that the actual product recedes into the background.</p>
